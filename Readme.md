## üöÄ Installation Guide

Follow these steps to set up and run this project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rahima-Akter/crowd-funding-backend.git
cd project-name
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
Install the necessary dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager):
```
```bash
npm install
```
# This will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file including:
- **cors, dotenv, express, mongodb**

### 3. Setup Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add your environment variables there. Here's an example of what your .env file might look like:

- **MONGO_URI=mongodb://your-mongo-uri**
- **SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key**
- ‚õîMake sure to replace the values with your actual credentials or API keys.***

# 4. Run the Project:
Once you have everything set up, you can run the project using:
```bash
npm start
```
- This will start the server and you should be able to access your app at http://localhost:3000.

### üìù How It Works:
Express handles the routing and server-side logic.
CORS is used to allow or restrict client-side access from different domains.
MongoDB is used for storing and retrieving data.
dotenv ensures that your sensitive information like database URIs and API keys are not hard-coded in the project.
### üîß Usage:
After running the server, you can make requests to your endpoints using tools like Postman or directly through your frontend app.
Ensure you are running MongoDB locally or use a cloud-based solution like MongoDB Atlas.
